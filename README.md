A repository for my random small programs I make for fun
## Programs
- [**Card Detection**](https://github.com/Chase-Horton/fun-programs/tree/main/card%20detection) detects suit and rank of cards from live webcam feed.
- [**Flatland**](https://github.com/Chase-Horton/random-projects/tree/main/Flatworld) a 1d vision simulation.
- [**Bang**](https://github.com/Chase-Horton/random-projects/tree/main/Bang) (as in !) a binary programming language designed for short program length when converted into text.
- [**HolyP**](https://github.com/Chase-Horton/fun-programs/tree/main/holyP) compiler written in Python that compiles into C then an executable using GCC.
- [**Solar System Sim**](https://github.com/Chase-Horton/random-projects/blob/main/idle-orbits.py) a simple vpython program which calculates the forces between the planets simulating the solar system and updates their positions accordingly with proportional speed and positions, (or with a few scenarios).
- [**fizzBuzz.py**](https://github.com/Chase-Horton/fun-programs/blob/main/fizzBuzz.py) A small program that prints fizzBuzz with obfuscation.
- [**Paint**](https://github.com/Chase-Horton/fun-programs/tree/main/paint) randomly draws abstract art in microsoft paint with specified parameters.
