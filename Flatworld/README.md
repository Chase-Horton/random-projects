Based on [**Flatland**](https://archive.org/details/flatlandromanceo00abbouoft) a book by a mathematician about what it would be like to live in a 2d world and see in 1d.
The program places you in a maze and you can disable the left side to navigate only using the 1d view on the right.

The only differences would be indicated by a different shades, sharper corners would be harsher gradients and you would be able to differentiate shapes by their gradient.
