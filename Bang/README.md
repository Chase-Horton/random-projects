My attempt to make the shortest fibonacci sequence program by making a binary programming language.It uses a dial or a tape of instructions that are built into the language and the only instructions are execute the current command or go to the next command.It is easily turing complete if you use the correct instructions on the tape
extremely inefficient on time for most uses however the goal was the smallest file size possible for code golf.
The python [**bang.py**](https://github.com/Chase-Horton/random-projects/blob/main/Bang/bang.py) was my first attempt which used 3 memory cells and a rotate memory command but this used too many instructions so I switched to a stack architecture, after improving it I made a webpage with svelte just to easily look at it. ![s](https://github.com/Chase-Horton/random-projects/blob/main/Bang/exampleOptimized.gif)
The program converts appends a 1 to the front and converts its binary into base 1.2 Million when saving files which leads to the fibonacci program only taking 1 character.

(and a handy decoder shows you the functions you will be pressing on the dials by reading the binary and calculating it beforehand)
